# Ape Fun Launchpad UI

This folder contains a minimal Next.js interface for interacting with the smart contracts in the root of this repository. It provides a Solana wallet connection, a sample chart component and a button to create a token using the provided library utilities.

## Getting Started

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Set the `KEYPAIR` and `RPC_URL` environment variables to point to your wallet and preferred RPC endpoint. The UI connects to devnet by default.
